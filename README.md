üõ†Ô∏è Feature Breakdown

User Management: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure authentication and personalized user experiences.
Property Management: Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. It provides the core functionality for property discovery and management.
Booking System: Facilitates property reservations, including check-in/check-out management. It ensures users can seamlessly book properties and hosts can manage bookings.
Payment Processing: Handles secure payment transactions for bookings. This feature ensures reliable and safe financial operations within the platform.
Review System: Allows users to post ratings and reviews for properties. It enhances trust and transparency by enabling feedback on user experiences.
Data Optimization: Implements indexing and caching to improve data retrieval speeds. This ensures a fast and responsive application for all users.

üîí API Security
Key Security Measures

Authentication: Uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identities and protect API endpoints.
Authorization: Implements role-based access control to ensure users only access resources they are permitted to.
Rate Limiting: Restricts the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

Importance of Security

Protecting User Data: Authentication and authorization safeguard sensitive user information, such as emails and passwords, from unauthorized access.
Securing Payments: Robust security measures ensure safe handling of financial transactions, protecting both users and the platform from fraud.
Preventing Abuse: Rate limiting protects the backend from denial-of-service attacks and ensures consistent performance for all users.

üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline
Overview
CI/CD pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes, ensuring a reliable and efficient development workflow. They are critical for maintaining code quality, catching bugs early, and enabling rapid deployment of new features.
Importance

CI/CD pipelines enable continuous integration by automatically testing code changes, reducing the risk of errors in production.
They support continuous deployment by streamlining the release process, ensuring the application remains up-to-date and scalable.

Tools

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment workflows directly within the GitHub repository.
Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production through containerization.
